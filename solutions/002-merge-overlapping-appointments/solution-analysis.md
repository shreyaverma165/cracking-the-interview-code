### Data Structure Brainstorm for Merging Overlapping Appointments

| Data Structure | Pros | Cons | Expected Time Complexity | Expected Space Complexity |
|----------------|------|------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Array** | Constant-time access to elements | Fixed size, inefficient for dynamic insertion and deletion; requires shifting elements | Sorting: O(n log n) Merging: O(n) Total: O(n log n) | In-place operations: O(1) additional space |
| **Heap** | Excellent for finding minimum or maximum elements, used in priority queues | Not suitable for maintaining sorted order or sequential access needed for merging intervals | Building heap: O(n) Extracting elements: O(n log n) Merging: O(n) Total: O(n log n) | Heap storage: O(n) |
| **Graph** | Useful for representing relationships and dependencies | Overcomplicated for this problem; requires additional traversal logic to merge intervals | Building the graph: O(n + e) Traversal: O(n + e) Total: O(n + e) | Graph storage: O(n + e) |
| **Tree** | Efficient for search, insertion, and deletion | Overhead of maintaining tree balance, unnecessary complexity for merging intervals | Building balanced tree: O(n log n) Insertion and search: O(log n) Merging: O(n) Total: O(n log n) | Tree storage: O(n) |
| **Dictionary (HashMap)** | Fast lookups | Does not maintain order, which is essential for merging intervals | Insertions: O(n) Lookups: O(1) Merging: O(n) Total: O(n) | HashMap storage: O(n) |
| **Stack** | Useful for Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) operations | Not ideal for maintaining sorted order, needed for merging intervals | Sorting: O(n log n) Merging: O(n) Total: O(n log n) | Stack storage: O(n) |
| **Queue** | Useful for First-In-First-Out (FIFO) operations | Not ideal for maintaining sorted order, needed for merging intervals | Sorting: O(n log n) Merging: O(n) Total: O(n log n) | Queue storage: O(n) |
| **LinkedList (or List)** | Dynamic resizing, efficient for appending and accessing elements, simple to implement | Slightly more overhead due to dynamic resizing but negligible in this context | Sorting: O(n log n) Merging: O(n) Total: O(n log n) | List storage: O(n) |

### Summary

Given the need to sort intervals and then merge them, the LinkedList (or simply a list) stands out as the most appropriate choice due to its simplicity, efficiency, and suitability for sorting and sequential access. Other data structures introduce unnecessary complexity or do not align well with the requirements of this specific problem. 

### Solution Overview

1. The input list of intervals is sorted based on the start time of each interval. This ensures that intervals are processed in chronological order, making it easier to merge overlapping intervals.
2. A `current` interval is initialized to the first interval in the sorted list.
3. The algorithm iterates through each interval in the sorted list:
    - If the `current` interval overlaps with the `next` interval (i.e., current.End >= interval.Start), the intervals are merged by updating the end time of the `current` interval to the maximum end time between the `current` and `next` intervals.
    - If there is no overlap, the `current` interval is added to the result list, and the `current` interval is updated to the `next` interval.
    - After the loop, the last `current` interval is added to the result list.
4. The result list containing the merged intervals is returned.

### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting:**
   - The first step in both solutions is to sort the list of intervals based on their start times. Sorting takes \(O(n log n)\) time, where \(n\) is the number of intervals.

2. **Merging:**
   - After sorting, the algorithm iterates through the sorted list of intervals once. This linear scan takes \(O(n)\) time.

Combining both steps, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step:
\[ O(n log n) + O(n) = O(n log n) \]

#### Space Complexity

1. **Auxiliary Space:**
   - The primary auxiliary space used is for the result list that stores the merged intervals. In the worst case, if no intervals are merged, the result list will store all \(n\) intervals, leading to \(O(n)\) space complexity.
   - Additionally, in Python, the `sort` method uses \(O(n)\) extra space for sorting. In C#, the in-place sorting algorithm used by `List.Sort()` typically uses \(O(1)\) extra space.

2. **Additional Variables:**
   - Both implementations use a few extra variables (`current` interval, and loop variables), which require \(O(1)\) space.

Thus, the overall space complexity is:
\[ O(n) \]

### Summary

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n log n)\)
  - Dominated by the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
  - For storing the result list and additional space used by the sorting algorithm.

The solutions are efficient in terms of both time and space, making them suitable for handling large lists of intervals in real-world applications such as scheduling and resource allocation.
