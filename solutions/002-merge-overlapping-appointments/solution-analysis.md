### Solution Overview

1. The input list of intervals is sorted based on the start time of each interval. This ensures that intervals are processed in chronological order, making it easier to merge overlapping intervals.
2. A `current` interval is initialized to the first interval in the sorted list.
3. The algorithm iterates through each interval in the sorted list:
    - If the `current` interval overlaps with the `next` interval (i.e., current.End >= interval.Start), the intervals are merged by updating the end time of the `current` interval to the maximum end time between the `current` and `next` intervals.
    - If there is no overlap, the `current` interval is added to the result list, and the `current` interval is updated to the `next` interval.
    - After the loop, the last `current` interval is added to the result list.
4. The result list containing the merged intervals is returned.

### Time and Space Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting:**
   - The first step in both solutions is to sort the list of intervals based on their start times. Sorting takes \(O(n log n)\) time, where \(n\) is the number of intervals.

2. **Merging:**
   - After sorting, the algorithm iterates through the sorted list of intervals once. This linear scan takes \(O(n)\) time.

Combining both steps, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step:
\[ O(n log n) + O(n) = O(n log n) \]

#### Space Complexity

1. **Auxiliary Space:**
   - The primary auxiliary space used is for the result list that stores the merged intervals. In the worst case, if no intervals are merged, the result list will store all \(n\) intervals, leading to \(O(n)\) space complexity.
   - Additionally, in Python, the `sort` method uses \(O(n)\) extra space for sorting. In C#, the in-place sorting algorithm used by `List.Sort()` typically uses \(O(1)\) extra space.

2. **Additional Variables:**
   - Both implementations use a few extra variables (`current` interval, and loop variables), which require \(O(1)\) space.

Thus, the overall space complexity is:
\[ O(n) \]

### Summary

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n log n)\)
  - Dominated by the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
  - For storing the result list and additional space used by the sorting algorithm.

The solutions are efficient in terms of both time and space, making them suitable for handling large lists of intervals in real-world applications such as scheduling and resource allocation.
