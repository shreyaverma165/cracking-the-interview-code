### Solution Analysis: Search in Rotated Sorted Array

## Data Structure Brainstorm

| Data Structure | Pros | Cons | Expected Time Complexity | Expected Space Complexity |
|----------------|------|------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Array** | Simple and straightforward | Inefficient for O(log n) search if not sorted | Linear search: O(n) Binary search: O(log n) if sorted | O(1) |
| **Heap** | Efficient for priority queue operations | Not suitable for binary search | Building heap: O(n) Searching: O(n) | O(n) |
| **Graph** | Can represent complex relationships | Overcomplicated for simple search | Searching: O(V + E) | O(V + E) |
| **Tree** | Efficient for search operations | Overhead of maintaining tree balance; unnecessary complexity for array search | Balanced search: O(log n) | O(n) |
| **Dictionary (HashMap)** | Fast lookups for exact matches | Does not support range queries or sorted order | Lookup: O(1) | O(n) |
| **Stack** | Useful for depth-first search | Not suitable for binary search in array | Searching: O(n) | O(n) |
| **Queue** | Useful for breadth-first search | Not suitable for binary search in array | Searching: O(n) | O(n) |
| **Binary Search (Modified)** | Efficient for sorted or rotated sorted arrays | Requires understanding of rotation point | Searching: O(log n) | O(1) |

### Summary

Given the need to search in a rotated sorted array efficiently, a modified binary search is the most appropriate choice due to its logarithmic time complexity and constant space complexity. Other data structures either introduce unnecessary complexity or are not well-suited for the specific needs of this problem.

### Solution Description

The problem involves finding the index of a target element in a rotated sorted array. The array was originally sorted in ascending order but then rotated at some pivot unknown beforehand. To achieve O(log n) runtime complexity, a modified binary search approach is used. The algorithm works by comparing the target element with the mid-point of the current search range and adjusting the search range based on the sorted side of the array.

### Time Complexity

- **Searching:** O(log n) - The binary search approach ensures that the search space is halved with each iteration.

Overall time complexity: O(log n).

### Space Complexity

- **Space:** O(1) - The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

Overall space complexity: O(1).
