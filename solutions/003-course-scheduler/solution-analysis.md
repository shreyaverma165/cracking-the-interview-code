### Data Structure Brainstorm for Course Scheduler I, II, and III

| Data Structure | Pros | Cons | Expected Time Complexity | Expected Space Complexity |
|----------------|------|------|--------------------------|---------------------------|

### Summary

For Course Scheduler problems, graphs are the most appropriate data structure due to their ability to represent complex dependencies and support traversal and cycle detection algorithms. Other data structures either introduce unnecessary complexity or are not well-suited for the specific needs of course scheduling.

### Solution Overview

### Course Scheduler I

### Description

Course Scheduler I involves determining if it is possible to finish all courses given the list of prerequisites. This problem can be modeled as a directed graph where each course is a node, and a directed edge from node `a` to node `b` indicates that course `b` is a prerequisite of course `a`. The problem then reduces to detecting if there is a cycle in the graph.

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.
   - Each index in the list represents a course, and the values at each index represent the courses that depend on it.

2. **Cycle Detection:**
   - Perform Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles.
   - Use a `visited` array to track the state of each node (unvisited, visiting, visited).

### Time Complexity

- Building the graph: \(O(E + V)\), where \(E\) is the number of edges (prerequisites) and \(V\) is the number of vertices (courses).
- DFS traversal: \(O(E + V)\).

Overall time complexity: \(O(E + V)\).

### Space Complexity

- Adjacency list: \(O(E + V)\).
- `visited` array: \(O(V)\).

Overall space complexity: \(O(E + V)\).

## Course Scheduler II

### Description

Course Scheduler II involves finding an order in which courses should be taken to finish all courses. This problem can also be modeled as a directed graph and involves finding a topological ordering of the nodes.

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.
   - Use an array to keep track of the in-degree of each node.

2. **Topological Sorting:**
   - Use Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting.
   - Initialize a queue with nodes that have an in-degree of 0.
   - Process nodes in the queue, reducing the in-degree of their neighbors, and add neighbors with an in-degree of 0 to the queue.

### Time Complexity

- Building the graph: \(O(E + V)\).
- Topological sort: \(O(E + V)\).

Overall time complexity: \(O(E + V)\).

### Space Complexity

- Adjacency list: \(O(E + V)\).
- `indegree` array: \(O(V)\).
- Queue for BFS: \(O(V)\).

Overall space complexity: \(O(E + V)\).

## Course Scheduler III

### Description

Course Scheduler III involves finding the maximum number of courses that can be taken without exceeding the deadlines. This problem can be approached using a greedy algorithm with a max heap.

1. **Course Sorting:**
   - Sort courses by their end times.

2. **Greedy Algorithm with Max Heap:**
   - Use a max heap to keep track of course durations.
   - Iterate through the sorted courses, adding each course if it fits within the current time limit.
   - If a course does not fit, replace the longest course in the max heap if the current course is shorter.

### Time Complexity

- Sorting courses: \(O(n log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of courses.
- Iterating through courses and heap operations: \(O(n log n)\).

Overall time complexity: \(O(n log n)\).

### Space Complexity

- Max heap: \(O(n)\).

Overall space complexity: \(O(n)\).
