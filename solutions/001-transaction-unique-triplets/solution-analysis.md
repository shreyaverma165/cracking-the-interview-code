## Solution Overview

1. The first step is to sort the list of transaction amounts. Sorting the transactions helps in efficiently finding the triplets that sum up to the target value. After sorting, we initialize three pointers: `i`, `left`, and `right`. The pointer `i` iterates through each transaction, while `left` starts from the next element `(i + 1)` and `right` starts from the last element in the list.
2. For each transaction at position `i`, the algorithm calculates the sum of the transactions at pointers `i`, `left`, and `right`. If the sum equals the target value, the triplet is added to the result list. To avoid duplicates, the algorithm skips over any duplicate values by comparing the current value with the previous one. If the `sum is less than the target`, it means we need a larger sum, so we move the `left` pointer to the `right`. Conversely, if the `sum is greater than the target`, we need a smaller sum, so we move the `right` pointer to the `left`. This process continues until all possible triplets are found.
3. To ensure that no duplicate triplets are included in the result, the algorithm skips over duplicate values for the `i`, `left`, and `right` pointers. Additionally, the results are cached using an in-memory cache mechanism. This caching improves performance for repeated queries by storing the results of previous computations and retrieving them quickly when the same query is encountered again.

## Time and Space Complexity

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the `FindTransactionTriplets` function is driven by two main operations: sorting the list and then iterating through it to find the triplets.

1. **Sorting the List:**
   The sorting operation takes \(O(n log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the `transactions` list.

2. **Finding the Triplets:**
   After sorting, the algorithm uses a nested loop approach:
   - The outer loop runs \(n - 2\) times, which is \(O(n)\).
   - Inside the outer loop, there is a two-pointer technique that processes the remaining elements in a linear fashion. For each position of `i`, the `left` and `right` pointers scan through the rest of the list. This takes \(O(n)\) in the worst case for each iteration of the outer loop.

Hence, the inner loop and the two-pointer scan together have a complexity of \(O(n)\). Since this inner operation happens \(n\) times (once for each element in the sorted list, excluding the last two elements), the overall complexity for this part is \(O(n^2)\).

Combining both parts, the total time complexity is:
\[ O(n log n) + O(n^2) = O(n^2) \]
Therefore, the dominant term is \(O(n^2)\), making the overall time complexity \(O(n^2)\).

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of the algorithm is primarily determined by the space required to store the result and the space used by the sorting operation.

1. **Result Storage:**
   - The result list stores the triplets that sum up to the target. In the worst case, if there are a large number of valid triplets, the result can take \(O(k)\) space, where \(k\) is the number of triplets found.
   
2. **Sorting:**
   - The sorting operation typically requires \(O(n)\) space if an in-place sorting algorithm like Timsort (used by C#'s `List.Sort()`) is employed. However, since this space is reused, it doesn't add to the final space complexity.

3. **Auxiliary Space:**
   - The algorithm uses a few extra variables (`left`, `right`, and `sum`), which require \(O(1)\) additional space.

Thus, the overall space complexity is dominated by the result storage, which is \(O(k)\). However, since \(k\) can be large, the space complexity is effectively \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case where every possible triplet is valid.

## Accuracy and Efficiency

The algorithm is highly accurate for finding all unique triplets that sum to a given target in a list of transactions. The accuracy is ensured by:
1. Sorting the list to facilitate the two-pointer approach.
2. Skipping duplicate elements to avoid duplicate triplets.
3. Using a systematic search with two pointers to ensure all combinations are checked efficiently.

The two-pointer technique is particularly efficient because it reduces the number of redundant checks that would otherwise occur in a naive three-loop implementation. By leveraging the sorted order, the algorithm can quickly adjust pointers based on the current sum, ensuring all possible triplets are considered without unnecessary comparisons.

Overall, the `FindTransactionTriplets` function is both time and space efficient for large datasets, making it well-suited for real-time transaction analysis in a high-volume e-commerce system. The caching mechanism further enhances performance for repeated queries, making it a robust solution for practical applications in detecting unusual spending patterns or high-value transaction clusters.
