### Solution Analysis: Sliding Window Rate Limiter

## Data Structure Brainstorm

| Data Structure | Pros | Cons | Expected Time Complexity | Expected Space Complexity |
|----------------|------|------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Array** | Simple and straightforward | Inefficient for dynamic timestamps and sliding window; requires shifting elements | Insertion: O(n) Deletion: O(n) Checking: O(n) | O(n) |
| **Heap** | Efficient for finding minimum or maximum elements | Not suitable for maintaining order of timestamps for sliding window | Insertion: O(log n) Deletion: O(log n) Checking: O(n log n) | O(n) |
| **Graph** | Can represent complex relationships | Overcomplicated for maintaining order of timestamps; not suitable for sliding window | Insertion: O(n) Deletion: O(n) Checking: O(n^2) | O(n) |
| **Tree** | Efficient for search and range queries | Overhead of maintaining tree balance; not suitable for sliding window | Insertion: O(log n) Deletion: O(log n) Checking: O(n log n) | O(n) |
| **Dictionary (HashMap)** | Fast lookups and flexible structure | Does not inherently support ordering of timestamps; not suitable for sliding window | Insertion: O(1) Deletion: O(1) Checking: O(n) | O(n) |
| **Stack** | Useful for depth-first search and backtracking | Not suitable for maintaining order of timestamps for sliding window | Insertion: O(1) Deletion: O(1) Checking: O(n) | O(n) |
| **Queue (Deque)** | Efficient for maintaining order of timestamps; suitable for sliding window | Limited utility for complex operations beyond sliding window | Insertion: O(1) Deletion: O(1) Checking: O(1) | O(n) |

### Summary

Given the need to maintain a sliding window of timestamps and check the number of requests efficiently, the Queue (or Deque) stands out as the most appropriate choice due to its simplicity, efficiency, and suitability for maintaining order and performing insertions and deletions in constant time. Other data structures introduce unnecessary complexity or are not well-suited for the specific needs of a sliding window rate limiter.

### Solution Description

The Sliding Window Rate Limiter ensures that no more than a certain number of requests are processed within a sliding time window. The implementation involves maintaining a queue of timestamps for each user. The queue is used to store the timestamps of the user's requests within the defined time window. When a new request comes in, the rate limiter checks if the number of requests within the time window exceeds the limit. If not, the request is allowed and the timestamp is added to the queue; otherwise, the request is denied.

### Time Complexity

- **Insertion:** O(1) - Adding a new timestamp to the queue is a constant time operation.
- **Deletion:** O(1) - Removing outdated timestamps from the front of the queue is a constant time operation.
- **Checking:** O(1) - Checking the size of the queue and comparing it to the rate limit is a constant time operation.

Overall time complexity: O(1) for each request.

### Space Complexity

- **Space:** O(n) - The space complexity is proportional to the number of requests in the sliding window for each user. In the worst case, the queue will store all requests within the time window.

Overall space complexity: O(n).
